        // The above lines state that if a high module or class depends more on low-level modules or classes,
        // your code would have tight coupling, and if you try to change one class, it can break another class,
        // which is risky at the production level.
        // So always try to make classes loosely coupled as much as possible, and you can achieve this
        // through abstraction. The main motive of this principle is decoupling the dependencies so if
        // class A changes the class B doesnâ€™t need to care or know about the changes.

        // As per the dependency inversion principle, a high-level class/module is something that is
        // dependent on other low-level classes/modules, and a low-level class/module is
        // something that is not dependent on other classes. Details are nothing but the class
        // which is having code for getting actual data.

        // the payment without any impact, proving the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
